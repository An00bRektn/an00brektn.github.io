title: 'Cyberforce 2023: Writeups'

## Intro
Part of the Cyberforce competition I covered last week was the anomaly section, with ~60 CTF-style challenges to be solved. Admittedly, some of them were a lot more work than they were worth, but this year, many of them were weighted towards reverse engineering and some forensics. I didn't get a lot of time to really work on these during the event as I was bogged down in incident response, but here are some writeups, mostly for me, if we're being honest. 


## What's Up Bro? (formerly brah)
> Anomaly 13

### Description
`We have noticed some suspicious activity leaving a particular machine in the network. We have isolated the machine and recorded its behavior over the course of 20 minutes or so. Either way it is not a full day so hopefully it was enough to get what we need for analysis.

`We are worried it is exfiltrating some data over a C2 channel but we have not been able to pinpoint the channel. Our only indicator is some shady website online that keeps showing data that has been leaked from our network and specifically data on that machine!`

Author: @pascal_0x90 (LLNL - Nate)
### Challenge
We're only given the README.md with the description and the packet capture, so we can pop the packet capture right into Wireshark. Since the packet capture is ~14 MB, we can use the statistics tab to get a gist of what's at play here, and we find *a lot* of TLS traffic.

![Pasted%20image%2020231108222526.png](https://an00brektn.github.io/img/cyberforce23/Pasted%20image%2020231108222526.png)

In order to decrypt TLS, we would somehow need to get access to the session keys, which, unless they were transmitted in cleartext at some point over HTTP, we're not getting them. The next most frequent protocol is DNS, which is actually quite interesting given the description.

### Solution
[Unit 42](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/dns-tunneling-how-dns-can-be-abused-by-malicious-actors/) has a very solid blog explaining exactly how this technique works, and you can see examples of it documented with [Sliver](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/wiki/DNS-C2) or [Cobalt Strike](https://hstechdocs.helpsystems.com/manuals/cobaltstrike/current/userguide/content/topics/listener-infrastructue_beacon-dns.htm). The core idea is that if I have a DNS server and keep track of the DNS queries made to the server, in this case for A records, I can parse data transmitted in the subdomain as arbitrary data, as opposed to actual DNS information. This is not the only way DNS can be leveraged for covert operations. For instance, a TXT record could be used to store payloads that could then be used in PowerShell payloads (source: [Alh4zr3d](https://twitter.com/Alh4zr3d/status/1566489367232651264), [John Hammond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3fi9pc81NY)).

If we filter the packet capture for DNS, we see this in action.

![Pasted%20image%2020231108232104.png](https://an00brektn.github.io/img/cyberforce23/Pasted%20image%2020231108232104.png)

The goal now is to recover the data sent through here. Rather than copy this out by hand, we can use `pyshark` like we did with [corCTF 2022: whack-a-frog](https://notateamserver.xyz/corctf22/#whack-a-frog) to automate this process.

```python
import pyshark

def get_domains():
    pcap_path = "./out.pcap"
    domains = []
    packets = pyshark.FileCapture(pcap_path, display_filter="dns")

    print("[*] Parsing packets...")
    for pkt in packets:
        if pkt.dns.qry_name and "cybrforce.io" in pkt.dns.qry_name and pkt.dns.qry_name not in domains:
            domains.append(pkt.dns.qry_name)
    packets.close()
    print("[+] Parsing complete.")
    return domains

domains = get_domains()
payload = ""
for d in domains:
    payload += d.split(".")[0]

print(bytes.fromhex(payload))
```

One thing to note is the `pkt.dns.qry_name not in domains` in the if statement; DNS uses UDP, which doesn't exactly prioritize the continuity of packets, and instead focuses on speed. As a result, UDP packets can get transmitted multiple times. This is not a perfect solution, as the same domain may have been used in two different places with how the plaintext might have been split up, but it ends up working fine here.

If we run the script, we see some base64:
```shell
kali@transistor:~/Documents/cyberforce-23/anomalies/Z-2023 CFC Dependency Files/Anomaly 13 - What’s up Bro (formerly brah)/challenge_dist$ python3 parse.py

```

We can add an extra line to then decode the base64, and find the flag:
```shell

## EmojiWare
> Anomaly 14

### Description

`This is an entire program written in emojis... Yes. You heard right. Emojis! The program that is in this challenge is an emulator that can interpret the emojis and provide emulation support. The code created acts like all the files on the computer have been encrypted. The goal of this challenge? Get the program to print out the encrypted flag.`

Author: @pascal_0x90 (LLNL - Nate)
### Challenge

We're given a few files to work with here.

```shell
kali@transistor:~/Documents/cyberforce-23/anomalies/Z-2023 CFC Dependency Files/Anomaly 14 - EmojiWare/dist$ ls -la
total 6500
drwxr-xr-x 2 kali kali    4096 Nov  2 15:22 .

-rw-r--r-- 1 kali kali     378 Nov  2 15:23 README.txt
```

The `README.txt` contained the description, so that's unimportant. The `emojis.out` is exactly what it sounds like, it's a lot of emojis.
```shell
kali@transistor:~/Documents/cyberforce-23/anomalies/Z-2023 CFC Dependency Files/Anomaly 14 - EmojiWare/dist$ head emojis.out

```

The `emulator` is an ELF executable that seems like the point of interest here, but we'll come back to that shortly. 

```shell
kali@transistor:~/Documents/cyberforce-23/anomalies/Z-2023 CFC Dependency Files/Anomaly 14 - EmojiWare/dist$ file emulator
emulator: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=b3a59e7c076b3b5dce5196ca64d323f0e0d84424, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, stripped
```

The `Dockerfile` is an interesting addition, since `emulator` isn't built on some esoteric architecture. Reading it, we get an interesting clue.

```python
FROM ubuntu:18.04

RUN apt update && apt install -y gcc python3.8-dev

ADD ./emulator /emulator
ADD ./emojis.out /emojis.out
WORKDIR /

ENTRYPOINT ["/emulator"]
```

It doesn't make sense to explicitly include `python3.8-dev` without actual python unless (a) this is a distraction or (b) there's some Python-magic going on here. If we start running through our basic reversing checks, something immediately jumps out at us:

```shell

### Solution
Notice the references to Python? Unless the author was trying to make it seem as if this was written with Python, there is very real likelihood that this binary was produced by using some library to compile Python to executable code. We can test this by pointing [pyinstxtractor](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor) at it.

```shell
kali@transistor:~/Documents/cyberforce-23/anomalies/Z-2023 CFC Dependency Files/Anomaly 14 - EmojiWare/dist$ python3 pyinstxtractor.py emulator

You can now use a python decompiler on the pyc files within the extracted directory
```

Our hypothesis was right, and we can now dig into the `emulator_extracted/` directory to find `emulator.pyc` which has the Python byte code in it (i.e. a compiled Python file, which is what the interpreter actually parses).

```shell
kali@transistor:~/Documents/cyberforce-23/anomalies/Z-2023 CFC Dependency Files/Anomaly 14 - EmojiWare/dist$ ls -la emulator_extracted/

I'm in the process of writing something on reversing Python malware, so I'll save an in-depth discussion of the topic for then, but `pycdc` is nice in that we can clone the repo, build the project, and just point the decompiler at the `.pyc` file. The build instructions aren't entirely clear from the repo, but you can just set up the Makefile using `cmake` and go from there.

```shell
kali@transistor:~/Documents/cyberforce-23/anomalies$ cd pycdc/
kali@transistor:~/Documents/cyberforce-23/anomalies/pycdc$ cmake -S .

[trim...]
```

I'll move the `emulator.pyc` out to a different directory, and then point `pycdc` at it to obtain the original source code.

```shell
kali@transistor:~/Documents/cyberforce-23/anomalies/Z-2023 CFC Dependency Files/Anomaly 14 - EmojiWare/dist$ ../../../pycdc/pycdc emulator.pyc
# Source Generated with Decompyle++

class ISA(Enum):
    IMM = auto()
    ADD = auto()

```

We get a couple of warnings, but it seems like we get most of the source code, which we can put in a separate `.py` file for easier viewing. The file itself comes out to be ~400 lines, so I might put it in a gist or on GitHub later, so we'll only be looking at the most relevant segments.

We've solved a challenge similar in concept to this before here, HTB's [Alien Saboteur](https://notateamserver.xyz/ca23-alien-saboteur/) challenge was a nice introduction to VM reversing challenges, and I highly recommend you check that out if you're unfamiliar with the idea. Luckily for us here, the emulator is written in Python, so more of the work is on parsing the `emojis.out` than actually reversing the VM. Lines 36 - 72 give us what each of the emojis mean.

```python
VMCODE = {
    '🈳': ISA.NOP,
    '➕': ISA.ADD,
    '😖': ISA.ADDI,
    '➖': ISA.SUB,
    '✨': ISA.SUBI,
    '❌': ISA.MULT,
    '⏬': ISA.PUSH,
    '🔝': ISA.POP,
    '😄': ISA.LDM,
    '😭': ISA.STM,
    '💯': ISA.CMP,
    '🚀': ISA.JMP,
    '🌮': ISA.JMPN,
    '💀': ISA.SYS,
    '👻': ISA.IMM,
    '🥑': ISA.XOR }
VMDATA = {
    '🤖': 0,
    '😍': 1,
    '💢': 2,
    '🤙': 3,
    '😩': 4,
    '👾': 5,
    '🤢': 6,
    '😿': 7,
    '💙': 8,
    '🙉': 9,
    '🙈': 10 }
REGS = {
    '🤡': 'SP',
    '🦷': 'IP',
    '😡': 'A',
    '😓': 'B',
    '😷': 'C',
    '🤥': 'D',
    '😿': 'F' }
```

The emulator, as expected, tells us exactly how to interpret these opcodes in the `interp_instr()` function.

```python
def parse_instr(self = None, instr = None):
	opcode = instr[self.order[0]]
	arg1 = instr[self.order[1]]
	arg2 = instr[self.order[2]]
	return (opcode, arg1, arg2)
# ...trim...
def interp_instr(self, instr):
	(opcode, arg1, arg2) = self.parse_instr(instr)
	op = VMCODE[opcode]
	if op == ISA.NOP:
		temp = 3
		temp2 = 2 + temp
		temp3 = temp + temp2
		del temp3
		del temp2
		return None
	if None == ISA.ADD:
		(r1name, reg1val) = self.get_register_value(arg1)
		(_, reg2val) = self.get_register_value(arg2)
		val = reg1val + reg2val
		calculated = val
		self.set_register_value(r1name, calculated)
		return None
	if None == ISA.ADDI:
		(r1name, reg1val) = self.get_register_value(arg1)
		imm = VMDATA[arg2]
		val = reg1val + imm
		calculated = val
		self.set_register_value(r1name, calculated)
		return None
	# trim...
```

An interesting thing to note is the `Processor()` class that this is all coming from seems to have code to debug the registers.

```python
def print_regs(self):
	regs = f'''\n======\nSP: {self._REGISTERS.SP}\nIP: {(self._REGISTERS.IP - 2048) / 3}\n======\nA: {self._REGISTERS.A}\nB: {self._REGISTERS.B}\nC: {self._REGISTERS.C}\nD: {self._REGISTERS.D}\n======\nF: {self._REGISTERS.F}\n======\nSTACK (first 10 values from SP):\n{self._MEM[max(0, (self._REGISTERS.SP - 10) + 1):self._REGISTERS.SP + 1]}\n======\n        '''
	print(regs)


def load_code(self, exec_code):
	'''
	MEM:
	code
	stack
	data_stored
	'''
	code = deepcopy(exec_code)
	MAX_SIZE = roundup(len(code) + 2048)
	self._MEM = [
		''] * MAX_SIZE
	for i in range(len(code)):
		self._MEM[i + 2048] = code[i]
	stats = f'''\n        CODE LENGTH: {len(code)}\n        MEM  LENGTH: {len(self._MEM)}\n        '''
	print(stats)


def init_registers(self = None):
	if self._REGISTERS is not None:
		print('Overriding a current state!')
		s = input('Continue? [yY/nN]')
		if 'n' in s.lower():
			return -1
		self._REGISTERS = None(0, 2048, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
		return 0
```

However, it seems like these functions don't get used in the actual execution of the program when we try to run the emulator (which I totally forgot to check until now).

```shell
$ ./emulator

From here, there's a couple of different ways to go about this:
1. Write a disassembler like we did for Alien Saboteur
2. Clean up the `emulator.py` we got from `pycdc` and use that to debug the registers
3. Debug `emulator` with GDB and find the right things to breakpoint on

The third is definitely the worst way to go about this, since it's still using Python bytecode in the ELF, so we're not only debugging the emoji VM, but also the underlying Python VM used to make the emulator. As for the other two options, I actually originally tried to do option 1, but when I did, I got 54873 instructions. For reference, the other VM challenge I did only had < 1000. For sanity's sake (although the brain worms want me to look at the assembly), we're reconstructing the emulator.

As good as `pycdc` is, it did not give us a perfect decompile. For one, there's various `continue` statements strewn across the program in weird spots, and I also have ambiguous things happening:

```python
REGISTERS = dataclass(<NODE:12>)
FILE = dataclass(<NODE:12>)
```

Part of the reason Python bytecode reversing is so funky is that with every new release of Python, the way control flow works is *slightly* different. `pycdc`'s merits come from the fact it's written in C++ and generally does not care for the version up until the more recent ones. However, it seems as though we might need to use a Python tool instead, and I used [decompyle3](https://github.com/rocky/python-decompile3), because `pycdc` told us the version was 3.8, and that's what `decompyle3` was made for.

In order to use `decompyle3`, you'll need an install of Python 3.8. The easiest solution would probably be using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage the versions you have installed, but I used Docker. I pulled down the Python 3.8.5 Docker container, mounted my current directory using a volume, and then entered the container. 

> Note, when using volumes, make sure your path has no weird characters in it or spaces, you'll get an error like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48522615/docker-error-invalid-reference-format-repository-name-must-be-lowercase) and be confused until you remember why!

This `emulator.py` is already *way* better if you look at the source code. Let's try running it and see what happens to make sure it works.

```shell
kali@transistor:~/Documents/cyberforce-23/anomalies/2023-CFC-Dependencies/A14-Emojiware/dist$ python3 emulator.py

    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

```

Ah. Very cool! This part took a minute to figure out, but the problem function is here:
```python
REGS_INV = {k: v for k, v in REGS.items()}
# ...trim...
def get_register_value(self, reg) -> Tuple[(str, int)]:
	try:
		emoji = REGS_INV[reg]
	except:
		emoji = reg
	else:
		if emoji == '🤡':
			return ('SP', self._REGISTERS.SP)
		if emoji == '🦷':
			return ('IP', self._REGISTERS.IP)
		if emoji == '😡':
			return ('A', self._REGISTERS.A)
		if emoji == '😓':
			return ('B', self._REGISTERS.B)
		if emoji == '😷':
			return ('C', self._REGISTERS.C)
		if emoji == '🤥':
			return ('D', self._REGISTERS.D)
		if emoji == '😿':
			return ('F', self._REGISTERS.F)
```

The problem is that the `REGS_INV` dictionary doesn't actually invert the keys and values, and the `else` statement here isn't really necessary. We can fix that pretty quickly though:
```python
REGS_INV = {v: k for k, v in REGS.items()}
# ...trim...
def get_register_value(self, reg) -> Tuple[(str, int)]:
	try:
		emoji = REGS_INV[reg]
	except:
		emoji = reg

	if emoji == '🤡':
		return ('SP', self._REGISTERS.SP)
	if emoji == '🦷':
		return ('IP', self._REGISTERS.IP)
	if emoji == '😡':
		return ('A', self._REGISTERS.A)
	if emoji == '😓':
		return ('B', self._REGISTERS.B)
	if emoji == '😷':
		return ('C', self._REGISTERS.C)
	if emoji == '🤥':
		return ('D', self._REGISTERS.D)
	if emoji == '😿':
		return ('F', self._REGISTERS.F)
```

If we try it again, we can safely say we've restored the emulator!

```shell
kali@transistor:~/Documents/cyberforce-23/anomalies/2023-CFC-Dependencies/A14-Emojiware/dist$ python3 emulator.py

```

So what's changed? Now that we have the Python source code, we can change things how ever we want! In particular, we can change the code that interprets instructions to print out exactly what's happening. Since this is a crackme, we can start by checking any uses of the `CMP` instruction.

```python
# ...trim
	if op == ISA.CMP:
		_, reg1val = self.get_register_value(arg1)
		_, reg2val = self.get_register_value(arg2)
		# NEW
		print(f"[DEBUG] {reg1val} == {reg2val}")
		self._REGISTERS.F = 0
		if reg1val == reg2val:
			self._REGISTERS.F |= 1
		if reg1val > reg2val:
			self._REGISTERS.F |= 2
		if reg1val < reg2val:
			self._REGISTERS.F |= 4
		if reg1val != reg2val:
			self._REGISTERS.F |= 8
		return
# trim...
```

If we try running the program now, we get a debug statement.
```shell

ENTER IN THE SECRET KEY:password
[DEBUG] 69 == 119
YOU HAVE ENTERED AN INCORRECT KEY! KILLING DECRYPTOR!
```

There are two things to be gleaned from this:
1. Despite submitting an 8 character entry, we only had one comparison. This could either be because of a length check, or it is checking one byte at a time and exiting if it's wrong.
2. 69 (nice) and 119 are both decimal values, neither of which correspond to the first character. 119 could be the "w" in the middle of the password but that's just weird.

If we make a hypothesis and assume that there's some encryption going on, we could try to hook the XOR opcode as well and see what happens.

```shell
kali@transistor:~/Documents/cyberforce-23/anomalies/2023-CFC-Dependencies/A14-Emojiware/dist$ python3 emulator.py

[DEBUG]: A <-- 69 = 0 ^ 69

[trim...]
```

Turns out there's a lot of XORs, ~100 to be exact. We also see that there's an alternating pattern of XORs with 69 then 12, which we can only assume to be the key (remember that this is decimal!). I'll use the `cyclic` tool from pwntools to generate a string of 100 characters to see if I can pass the length check.

```

It still didn't give us additional CMP checks, but at least we can confirm that the XORs are being applied to the password. At this point, you could write a pwntools script to bruteforce the password, or we could try to "dump the memory" at the password check. I can modify the `execvm()` function as follows:

```python
def execvm(self):
	self.init_registers()
	self._REGISTERS.IP = 2048
	while self._REGISTERS.IP >= 2048:
		while self._REGISTERS.IP <= len(self._MEM):
			try:
				instr = self._MEM[self._REGISTERS.IP:self._REGISTERS.IP + 3]
				self.interp_instr(instr=instr)
			except KeyboardInterrupt:
				#self.print_regs()
				print(self._MEM[:2048])
				input()

			self._REGISTERS.IP += 3
```

Now, when I hit CTRL+C at the password prompt, I see this.

Interestingly, this is only ~32 bytes. Still, we can pull these numbers out, apply the XOR key, and see what the plaintext is.

> To any Cyberforce competitor, I sincerely apologize for the existence of this challenge. I am friends with the challenge author outside of this event and I am the one who mentioned Nim when that was hot (before I realized writing C, or even better, PIC shellcode, was God's way).

### Solution 1: Hardcoded Key
We're given a file called `smartmeter_management_interface.exe`, some additional information in `Question.md` that just adds some context that isn't necessarily worth mentioning here. If I run the binary, we're immediately hit with roadblock #1.

![Pasted%20image%2020231109001048.png](https://an00brektn.github.io/img/cyberforce23/Pasted%20image%2020231109001048.png)

Ah, a crackme. Of course.

Before jumping to disassembling the binary, let's briefly take a look at what PEStudio tells us. There are no immediately weird looking imports (e.g. `CreateRemoteThread`, `Nt*`), but as soon as we look at strings, we know what were up against.

![Pasted%20image%2020231109001529.png](https://an00brektn.github.io/img/cyberforce23/Pasted%20image%2020231109001529.png)

If it isn't my old enemy Nim. For the uninitiated, [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) is a language that was very hyped up last year in the red teaming space as something extremely evasive and hard to reverse engineer, while also embracing Python-like simplicity in syntax, yet supporting memory management and macros like languages like Rust or C++ do. An in-depth discussion of the merits of using Nim and other esolangs for malware development is beyond the scope of this blog, but the key factor we'll be dealing with is the reverse engineering bit. 

Nim compiles to C, and then uses a compiler for C to finish it off, meaning symbols and functions get seriously garbled. It's still very possible to work through it, it's just a pain. For languages like Nim, I prefer using [Cutter](https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter) over Ghidra. Once the binary is loaded into Cutter, we can start by looking for the main function. If we use the side bar to search for `main`, we're greeted with 6 different "mains".

![Pasted%20image%2020231109002523.png](https://an00brektn.github.io/img/cyberforce23/Pasted%20image%2020231109002523.png)

For the purposes of reverse engineering, we can usually jump right to `NimMainModule`. Keeping the window open in graph view, we have a little bit of noise from what Nim does at an assembly level, but we can stay focused if we just look for calls to other symbols that look like functions. Eventually, we should find `main__smartmeter95management95interface_528`, which is where we can actually see assembly that corresponds to what we saw with the execution. Let's zoom into the first block of assembly here:

If you've been following along, or you see this mess, you begin to understand why looking at Nim can be challenging- there's just a lot of stuff that you don't need to be looking at 90% of the time. However, at `0x14003826a`, we see a call to what looks like the function that prints the main banner. At `0x1400382ad`, we have another call, this time to the `accessMaintenanceInterface()` function. Looking at that function, this bit of assembly jumps out at me.

```c
0x14003444a      mov     qword [var_70h], rax
0x14003444e      mov     qword [var_20h], 0
0x140034456      mov     qword [var_28h], 0
0x14003445e      lea     rax, data.140048f80 ; 0x140048f80
0x140034465      mov     rcx, rax  ; int64_t arg1
0x140034468      call    decodeBase64__smartmeter95management95interface_89 ; sym.decodeBase64__smartmeter95management95interface_89
0x14003446d      mov     qword [var_28h], rax
0x140034471      mov     qword [var_30h], 0
0x140034479      lea     rax, data.140048fc0 ; 0x140048fc0
0x140034480      mov     rcx, rax  ; int64_t arg1
0x140034483      call    decodeBase64__smartmeter95management95interface_89 ; sym.decodeBase64__smartmeter95management95interface_89
0x140034488      mov     qword [var_30h], rax
0x14003448c      cmp     qword [var_28h], 0
0x140034491      je      0x14003449c
```

I don't know the exact calling convention at play here, but if I had to guess, those `data.1400...` addresses are being passed into the `decodeBase64()` function. Following those, we get two base64 strings: `Y2VhZTA5YzM5YTRiMjczOQ==` and `ZDVlMDMwODBmNDI2YzkyMA==`. We can decode them to get the values `ceae09c39a4b2739` and `d5e03080f426c920`, respectively. Concatenating these and decoding as hex gives random bytes, so we're still not entirely sure how this gets used. Later on in this function, however, we see the following:

```c
0x14003457c      call    readLine__systemZio_364 ; sym.readLine__systemZio_364
0x140034581      mov     qword [var_48h], rax
0x140034585      mov     qword [var_78h], 0x86 ; 134
0x14003458d      lea     rax, str.C:_Cyberforce_November_2023_smartmeter_management_interface.nim ; 0x14004ab90
0x140034594      mov     qword [var_70h], rax
0x140034598      mov     rax, qword [var_48h]
0x14003459c      mov     rcx, rax  ; int64_t arg1
0x14003459f      call    getMD5__OOZ85sersZmurraZOnimbleZpkgs50Zchecksums4548O49O48455352525551dcb50db5649cc5154fc54ac5154ab5453df48e4957525251534948Zch ; sym.getMD5__OOZ85sersZmurraZOnimbleZpkgs50Zchecksums4548O49O48455352525551dcb50db5649cc5154fc54ac5154ab5453df48e4957525251534948Zch
0x1400345a4      mov     qword [var_50h], rax
0x1400345a8      mov     qword [var_78h], 0x87 ; 135
0x1400345b0      lea     rax, str.C:_Cyberforce_November_2023_smartmeter_management_interface.nim ; 0x14004ab90
0x1400345b7      mov     qword [var_70h], rax
0x1400345bb      mov     rdx, qword [var_38h] ; int64_t arg2
0x1400345bf      mov     rax, qword [var_50h]
0x1400345c3      mov     rcx, rax  ; int64_t arg1
0x1400345c6      call    eqStrings ; sym.eqStrings_0x14003428e
```

That `getMD5` suggests that the user's input is actually being compared via hashing, so one might guess that the base64 strings encode the hash. We can try both ways, and using Crackstation, we eventually find that `ceae09c39a4b2739d5e03080f426c920` corresponds to `neverhere`.

We can try this in the terminal and see that it works.

### Solution 2: Data Deletion
Finding the other flags is a little bit of a challenge, as we don't really have direction for what to do other than look for vulnerabilities. However, we can do a little bit of metagaming and look for interesting strings, and we find the following.

![Pasted%20image%2020231111225615.png](https://an00brektn.github.io/img/cyberforce23/Pasted%20image%2020231111225615.png)

Since I am privy to the order of the flags, we'll start with the "insecure data deletion". First, let's try to look at this in the program. We have a few options related to configuration management:
- (3) Add Configuration
- (4) Delete Configuration
- (5) Update Configuration
- (6) Display Configuration
- (7) Process Configuration
- (12) Restore Configurations

If we display configurations, we see what's already loaded.
```shell
------------------------------------------------------------
                   CONFIGURATION DISPLAY
------------------------------------------------------------

DER8.9 SmartMeter WATT Control and Maintenance Interface
```

Let's try to delete it and see what happens.
```shell
Enter your choice:
4

------------------------------------------------------------
                    DELETE CONFIGURATION
------------------------------------------------------------

Enter maintenance token:
neverhere

Enter configuration ID to delete:

Well that was easy. Based on the string we found, let's try to restore it.

```shell

12

------------------------------------------------------------
                   RESTORE CONFIGURATION

ID: 999 Data: RESTORED DELETED DATA || INSECURE DATA DELETION FLAG #2: DONT-LOOK-BACK-AT-DELETED-DATA-I-HEARD-YOU-SAY


DER8.9 SmartMeter WATT Control and Maintenance Interface
```

Well that was even easier. Moral of the story, when data gets deleted, make sure it actually gets deleted and wiped from memory. We could dig into why this is happening by looking at the assembly, but this post is long enough as is and we have two more to get through. I might make a follow up post later to dive even deeper, but I'll be honest, I'm too tired to dig into this right now. 

**flag**: `DONT-LOOK-BACK-AT-DELETED-DATA-I-HEARD-YOU-SAY`
### Solution 3: JSON Deserialization
Another one of the strings had to do with deserialization, and we have two options that would be related to this.

- (10) Export Configurations as JSON
- (11) Import Configurations as JSON

If we try to call (10), we get this:
```shell
Enter your choice:
10

------------------------------------------------------------
                    EXPORT CONFIGURATION
------------------------------------------------------------

[{"id":999,"data":"5,7,0,2,24,7,14,16,5,14,16,19,2,23,6,8,19"}]

DER8.9 SmartMeter WATT Control and Maintenance Interface
```

It seems like we also have the option to submit our own data. I can submit a made up configuration and it seems like it goes through no problem.

```shell
Enter your choice:
11

Provide JSON data for configurations:
[{"id":123,"data":"1,1,1,1,1"}]

[...trim...]

Enter your choice:
10

------------------------------------------------------------
                    EXPORT CONFIGURATION
------------------------------------------------------------

[{"id":999,"data":"5,7,0,2,24,7,14,16,5,14,16,19,2,23,6,8,19"},{"id":123,"data":"1,1,1,1,1"}]
```

Looks like we can't submit arbitrary keys and values though:

```shell
Enter your choice:
11

Provide JSON data for configurations:
[{"fakeKey":"fakeValue"}]

------------------------------------------------------------
                    IMPORT CONFIGURATION
------------------------------------------------------------

C:\Cyberforce-November-2023\smartmeter_management_interface.nim(341) smartmeter_management_interface
C:\Cyberforce-November-2023\smartmeter_management_interface.nim(331) main
C:\Cyberforce-November-2023\smartmeter_management_interface.nim(261) importConfigurations
C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\nim\pure\json.nim(517) []
C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\nim\pure\collections\tables.nim(246) []
C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\nim\pure\collections\tables.nim(234) raiseKeyError
Error: unhandled exception: key not found: id [KeyError]
```

If that's the case, it seems like we need to find what the possible keys are. We have a couple of functions to look at as far as the Nim code goes: `exportConfigurations()`, `importConfigurations()`, `processConfiguration()`, `updateConfiguration()`. After a long winded journey of exploring the various functions, first `updateConfiguration()` then `importConfigurations()`, we find the following assembly.

```c
0x140037332      lea     rdx, data.14004a2a0 ; 0x14004a2a0 ; int64_t arg2
0x140037339      mov     rcx, rax  ; int64_t arg1
0x14003733c      call    hasKey__pureZjson_3212 ; sym.hasKey__pureZjson_3212
0x140037341      mov     byte [var_29h], al
0x140037344      movzx   eax, byte [var_29h]
0x140037348      xor     eax, 1
0x14003734b      test    al, al
0x14003734d      jne     0x140037384
0x14003734f      mov     qword [var_78h], 0
0x140037357      mov     rax, qword [var_48h]
0x14003735b      lea     rdx, data.14004a2a0 ; 0x14004a2a0 ; int64_t arg2
0x140037362      mov     rcx, rax  ; int64_t arg1
0x140037365      call    X5BX5D___pureZjson_3095 ; sym.X5BX5D___pureZjson_3095
0x14003736a      mov     qword [var_78h], rax
0x14003736e      mov     rax, qword [var_78h]
0x140037372      mov     edx, 0    ; int64_t arg2
0x140037377      mov     rcx, rax  ; int64_t arg1
0x14003737a      call    getBool__pureZjson_189 ; sym.getBool__pureZjson_189
0x14003737f      mov     byte [var_29h], al
0x140037382      jmp     0x140037385
0x140037384      nop
0x140037385      movzx   eax, byte [var_29h]
```

That `hasKey__pureZjson_3212` is particularly interesting, considering there's something going on with `data.14004a2a0` before it. If I follow that variable, the nearest string in Cutter is `isAdmin`, which absolutely looks like a key. We can also see a later call to `getBool`, which may imply the data type to go with the `isAdmin` key is a boolean. All together, we can try injecting some JSON.

```
Enter your choice:
11

Provide JSON data for configurations:
[{"isAdmin":true}]

ADMIN ACCESS GRANTED || INSECURE DESERIALIZATION FLAG #4: WOO-HOO-AND-IM-INSECURE-WITH-DESERIALIZATION


DER8.9 SmartMeter WATT Control and Maintenance Interface
```

Despite the fact that we're not using something like [ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) to get RCE, this is still deserialization! The JSON gets loaded into the program as some kind of dictionary structure, which is how it's checking for keys. Since there's no checks on what we can submit, that malicious config gets evaluated and injects the admin condition.

**flag**: `WOO-HOO-AND-IM-INSECURE-WITH-DESERIALIZATION`
### Solution 4: IDOR
Out last challenge has to do with an insecure direct object reference. We can use the success string to find exactly the code block we want to get to. One thing I learned while solving this is that you can't directly check for X-Refs from the string, you want to scroll up (at least in Cutter) for the `data.XXXXXXX` reference and use that.

![Pasted%20image%2020231112100625.png](https://an00brektn.github.io/img/cyberforce23/Pasted%20image%2020231112100625.png)

We're inside the `processConfiguration()` function, and the control flow graph is a little bit more complicated than we might want to look at statically. Let's take a look at what "processing" a configuration does.

```shell
Enter your choice:
7

------------------------------------------------------------
                   PROCESS CONFIGURATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------


Processed Configuration (Not a flag... sadly): USZXBSLJULJGXCTRG

(Hint: do you think the developers took out any backdoors for debug access?)


DER8.9 SmartMeter WATT Control and Maintenance Interface
```

While attempting to solve this one, I actually ended up reverse engineering the entire algorithm to go from configuration to processed string. It didn't help at all, but you can see from when we looked at the default configuration, the indices are all less than 26, and the resulting string is entirely alphabetic. If you look at the strings, you find the string `ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA-123456#`, which looks like a lookup array. For instance, the first number in the default config is 5, and U has index 5 (we're starting from Z = 0, sorry Lua devs).

Although figuring this out was fun, the solution is actually way simpler than that. Knowing what our end goal is, we can trace stuff back through the CFG to find what conditions are necessary to get to our end goal. At one point, we find this block:

```c
0x140035ee1      mov     rax, qword [var_50h]
0x140035ee8      mov     rax, qword [rax + 8]
0x140035eec      lea     rdx, data.140048a80 ; 0x140048a80 ; int64_t arg2
0x140035ef3      mov     rcx, rax  ; int64_t arg1
0x140035ef6      call    eqStrings ; sym.eqStrings_0x14003428e
0x140035efb      mov     byte [var_11h], al
0x140035f01      jmp     0x140035f04
```

The data in `data.140048a80` is `@5,7,0,2,24,7,14,16,5,14,16,19,2,23,6,8,19`, which is what the default config was. Following this is a call to `eqStrings` which probably does what it says it does, checks if two strings are equal. If we try submitting a new config like this, it doesn't look like anything changes.

```shell
Enter your choice:

```

There might be an additional check going on. In the block immediately before the `eqStrings`, we see another interesting comparison.

```c
0x140035eaf      mov     qword [var_130h], rax
0x140035eb3      mov     byte [var_11h], 0
0x140035eba      mov     rax, qword [var_50h]
0x140035ec1      mov     rax, qword [rax]
0x140035ec4      cmp     rax, 0x7c9 ; 1993
0x140035eca      sete    al
0x140035ecd      mov     byte [var_11h], al
0x140035ed3      movzx   eax, byte [var_11h]
0x140035eda      xor     eax, 1
0x140035edd      test    al, al
0x140035edf      jne     0x140035f03
```

Although this is Nim and there's a bunch of random noise that is happening, the comparison at `0x140035ec4` is such an oddly specific number. We could probably go backwards to confirm that this is a desired configuration ID, but there's no harm in trying. I'll restart the program and try again.

DEVELOPER DEBUG MODE ACTIVATED || Processed Configuration! INSECURE DIRECT OBJECT REFERENCE FLAG #3: INSECURE-REFS-LIKE-INSECURE-PROGRAMS-DO


DER8.9 SmartMeter WATT Control and Maintenance Interface
```

And that's the flag! In most examples of IDOR, it's usually about accessing information you shouldn't have access to by changing a parameter, usually an index. While this might not be that, I would still call it an IDOR in the sense that no normal user should just be able to call the debug mode by calling a specific ID (after all, we did find an admin attribute). It's mostly a problem of hard coded keys, but I don't think calling this IDOR is extremely wrong.

**flag**: `INSECURE-REFS-LIKE-INSECURE-PROGRAMS-DO`

## Conclusion
This year's Cyberforce main event had way more difficult challenges than previous years, and while some of them were extremely stupid (looking at you Ste-what-graphy), the progress the anomaly team has made over the years has been great. I still remember back in 2020 and 2021 where you could cheese half of the reversing and steg challenges by doing `strings binary | grep flag`. I wish I was able to solve these during the event, but got extremely bogged down in incident response, but I appreciate the work nonetheless.

If you're interested in doing some of these challenges yourself (and are a US collegiate student), [Cyberforce](https://cyberforce.energy.gov/) has some more events coming up that might be worth checking out. I'm not allowed back after [(allegedly) stealing the agenda](https://notateamserver.xyz/doe-cyberforce-23/) but that's besides the point :p

Until next time! :D
